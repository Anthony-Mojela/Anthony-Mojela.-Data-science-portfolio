### 📊 Data Analytics

 Retail Analytics|Excel BI|Operations ,Supply chain & Finance

 📌 Project summary

Built an interactive Excel dashboard used in a retail environment to measure, monitor, and communicate supplier service level performance. The dashboard supports supplier/vendor review sessions by highlighting where service failures occur and where improvement actions are required.

🎯 Business problem

Retailers depend on suppliers for consistent product availability. Poor service levels lead to:

empty shelves,

lost sales,

higher operational costs.

This project enables the business and suppliers to objectively track performance and make data-driven improvement decisions.

📊 Key features

Service level KPIs (e.g. fill rate, delivery performance, compliance trends)

Supplier and category performance comparisons

Time-series tracking to identify deterioration or improvement

Exception-based views to focus on underperforming suppliers

Automated refresh structure for recurring reports

🧠 What this demonstrates

Translating business problems into measurable KPIs

Data modeling and structuring for performance reporting

Analytical thinking applied to operations & supply chain

Building decision-support dashboards (not just visuals)

🛠 Tools & skills

Microsoft Excel

Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)

PivotTables & data modeling

Advanced formulas

KPI design & performance measurement

Dashboard UX and executive reporting
